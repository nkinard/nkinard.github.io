                                Trout are a very sought after species of fish in the Carolinas. 
                                There are many species of trout such as rainbow and brown, both with their 
                                own vibrant colors. These fish are mainly found in cooler waters such as streams
                                and rivers in the mountains. To find these kind of fish, you are going to want to
                                go to higher elevations such as the Appalachian mountains. Due to the 
                                elevations you may experience, these fish are most enjoyable to catch in the spring and fall time.

                            <p>
                                Trout are wild fish that love to fish on the natural food sources in the water. 
                                In the early Spring and Fall, trout love to bite on nymphs, which are imitations
                                of immature stages of aquatic insects. During hatch times, it is more relevant to 
                                use dry flies, which imitate more adult insects. If you want to attract larger trout, 
                                you can try to use streamers, which imitate bigger aquatic prey like baitfish and crayfish.

                            <p>
                                In the Carolinas, trout are best find in the mountain tops of Appalachia. In North Carolina, 
                                rivers like the Nantahala and Watauga are prime spots. In South Carolina, the Chattooga River 
                                in the right season can prove to be very rewarding for trout fishing.

                                Dry flies are a fly that imitate an adult insect.
                                This technique of fly fishing is best during seasons of insect hatches, 
                                when the fish are actively feeding on adult flies. Selecting the right fly pattern 
                                based on the water and ecosystem is key to making them effective. To cast, simply 
                                cast the fly out and make sure it sits carefully on the water, just as an adult fly would.

                            <p>
                                Dry flies are best used to imitate the adult stage of an aquatic insect. 
                                Some common flies in the Carolinas include mayflies, toneflies, and caddisflies. These 
                                flies are meant to drift on top of the water to feed, and then attract
                                fish that like to feed on the surface. Make sure to choose the right fly based on your local environment.
                                Some variables that can attribute to choosing the right fly include the season, 
                                the color of the water, the color of the environment, and what fish might lurk.

                            <p>
                                Top fish in the Carolinas that eat dry flies are fish like brown and rainbow trout. 
                                These fish love to surface feed on hatching insects. The best seasons are often in the 
                                Spring and Fall times. Another common fish to get are  smallmouth bass, however they 
                                are not as unique.

                            <p>
                                This library is sectioned off into the Fly Library and the Fish Library. 
                                In the Fish Library, there is information on the fish itself, its best flies to be used, and where to find them.
                                In the Fly Library, there is information on the fly itself, its main purpose, and what fish really love them. 
                                It is important to know that this guide is meant for the Carolinas, so species around the world may act different to this information.
