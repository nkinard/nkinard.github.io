                                The Chattooga River is one of the southeast's longest rivers and cuts through Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. 
                                This spectacular river is home to hundreds of different species of wildlife. The good thing about this river is that 
                                there is easy access at almost any point. There are times where the rapids pick up, but there are definitely spots for wading,
                                kayaking, or bank casting. The best, and most popular, access to the river is off of State Highway 28.
