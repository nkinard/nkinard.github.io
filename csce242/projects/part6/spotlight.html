            <h2>Saluda River Spotlight</h2>
            <section>
              <p>
                The Saluda River, named after an Algonquian-speaking tribe, runs
                from the Blue Ridge Mountains to Columbia, South Carolina's Lake
                Murray. The Saluda water is very temperate and offers great
                abundance in fish species. The North Saluda, near Greenville SC,
                is often more abundant in fish as the water is cooler, and as
                you get to the southern region near the dam in Lake Murray, the
                water temperature increases. Overall, this river is great for
                year round fishing and provides young anglers a good starting
                point.

                This large stream runs in the mountains of west North Carolina

                is really good for year-round fishing and provides anglers of

                The Mitchell River is a large freshwater river that runs in
                western North Carolina at the base of the Appalachian Mountains.
                This river is known for its delayed harvest trout where anglers
                are only allowed to keep catches during certain regulations set
                forth by the state. Due to this, the populations in this river
                are abundant and very rewarding. There are many access points
                near Kapps Mill along River Road. Go and try it out!
