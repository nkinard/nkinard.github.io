        "name": "Dry Fly",
        "summary": "Dry flies are a fly that imitate an adult insect. This technique of fly fishing is best during seasons of insect hatches, when the fish are actively feeding on adult flies. Selecting the right fly pattern based on the water and ecosystem is key to making them effective. To cast, simply cast the fly out and make sure it sits carefully on the water, just as an adult fly would.",

        "purpose": "Dry flies are best used to imitate the adult stage of an aquatic insect. Some common flies in the Carolinas include mayflies, toneflies, and caddisflies. These flies are meant to drift on top of the water to feed, and then attract fish that like to feed on the surface. Make sure to choose the right fly based on your local environment. Some variables that can attribute to choosing the right fly include the season, the color of the water, the color of the environment, and what fish might lurk.",
        "topfish": "Top fish in the Carolinas that eat dry flies are fish like brown and rainbow trout. These fish love to surface feed on hatching insects. The best seasons are often in the Spring and Fall times. Another common fish to get are smallmouth bass, however they are not as unique."
