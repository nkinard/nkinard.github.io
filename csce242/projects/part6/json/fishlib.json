        "summary": "The Chattooga River is one of the southeast's longest rivers and cuts through Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. This spectacular river is home to hundreds of different species of wildlife. The good thing about this river is that there is easy access at almost any point. There are times where the rapids pick up, but there are definitely spots for wading, kayaking, or bank casting. The best, and most popular, access to the river is off of State Highway 28.",

        "useflies": "Since Redfish are saltwater, you are going to need to use saltwater fly patterns. These fish are going to bite completely different from the normal freshwater fish and be a little more aggressive. The best flies include the Clouser Deep Minnow, Deep Baitfish Shad, or even a Squimp.",
        "topspots": "The best places to find these fish are in saltwater regions where bank or boat fishing is accessible. It is not reccommended to go wading for thein these fish. Top areas include the flats of Charleston and Beufort as well as the bays and lagoons in the Outer Banks."
