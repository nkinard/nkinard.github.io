                This cool saltwater fish finds itself in the marshes of both
                North and South Carolina. Due to thier extended range, you can
                gind them easy in early afternoon low tides, or schooling out
                deep around 30-40ft water. The best time to catch these depends
                on the time of the year as well as which marsh you are in. Some
                good spots in this area to try first are the shallow flats of
                Charleston and Beaufort.

                  Since Redfish are saltwater, you are going to need to use
                  saltwater fly patterns. These fish are going to bite
                  completely different from the normal freshwater fish and be a
                  little more aggressive. The best flies include the Clouser
                  Deep Minnow, Deep Baitfish Shad, or even a Squimp.

                  The best places to find these fish are in saltwater regions
                  where bank or boat fishing is accessible. It is not
                  reccommended to go wading for thein these fish. Top areas

                Trout are a very sought after species of fish in the Carolinas.
                There are many species of trout such as rainbow and brown, both
                with their own vibrant colors. These fish are mainly found in
                cooler waters such as streams and rivers in the mountains. To
                find these kind of fish, you are going to want to go to higher
                elevations such as the Appalachian mountains. Due to the
                elevations you may experience, these fish are most enjoyable to
                catch in the spring and fall time.

                  Trout are wild fish that love to fish on the natural food
                  sources in the water. In the early Spring and Fall, trout love
                  to bite on nymphs, which are imitations of immature stages of
                  aquatic insects. During hatch times, it is more relevant to
                  use dry flies, which imitate more adult insects. If you want
                  to attract larger trout, you can try to use streamers, which
                  imitate bigger aquatic prey like baitfish and crayfish.

                  In the Carolinas, trout are best find in the mountain tops of
                  Appalachia. In North Carolina, rivers like the Nantahala and
                  Watauga are prime spots. In South Carolina, the Chattooga
                  River in the right season can prove to be very rewarding for
                  trout fishing.

                Sheepshead fish are a common saltwater fish found piling up
                inshore around rocks and other underwater debris. They are known
                for their unique sharp teeth where they eat barnacles, oysters,
                and various types of shellfish. Due to this, you sohuld opt to
                use bait that mimics shellfish. The Sheepshead are easily
                recognizable with their distinctive black and white patters with
                large teeth. Further, Sheepshead are not very migratory and only
                move offshore to spawn in the Spring time.

                the more abundant fish in this area, bass love to be found in

                anything such as crayfish, frogs, insects, minnows, earthworms
                and sometimes even other bass. Due to their eating habits and
                predatory nature, bass can be dirty if the environment they live
                in allows for it. Make sure to always know your local body of

                  Catching bass has always been a good past-time in the

                Dry flies are a fly that imitate an adult insect. This technique
                of fly fishing is best during seasons of insect hatches, when
                the fish are actively feeding on adult flies. Selecting the
                right fly pattern based on the water and ecosystem is key to
                making them effective. To cast, simply cast the fly out and make
                sure it sits carefully on the water, just as an adult fly would.

                  Dry flies are best used to imitate the adult stage of an
                  aquatic insect. Some common flies in the Carolinas include
                  mayflies, toneflies, and caddisflies. These flies are meant to
                  drift on top of the water to feed, and then attract fish that
                  like to feed on the surface. Make sure to choose the right fly
                  based on your local environment. Some variables that can
                  attribute to choosing the right fly include the season, the
                  color of the water, the color of the environment, and what

                Emerger flies are lightweight flies that mimic the hatching of
                aquatic prey. Insects such as mayflies and caddis are usually
                the most popular insects that these flies try to mimic. They are
                designed to drift with the current of the water and slowly
                submerge just below the surface. This is to imitate the action
                of an insect hatching and leaving the steam bed to rise and fly
                away.

                These flies mimic any aquatic prey that finds itself underwater.
                The advantage of wet flies is that they can be used in both
                fresh and saltwaters. Also, wet flies can come in a plethora of
                designs, shapes, and patterns.

                <p>
                  Since wet flies are desgined to be submerged, many of these
                  flies are going to be color coordinated to their respective
                  river bed. Some common ones include the Gold Ribbed Hare's
                  Ear, and the Woolly Bugger.

              <h2>The Complete Fish and Fly Library of the Carolinas</h2>
              <p>
                Welcome to the Fish and Fly Library, a comprehensive resource
                giving quick information on fishes and flies to see and use in
                the Carolinas.
              </p>
              <p>
                This library is sectioned off into the Fly Library and the Fish
                Library. In the Fish Library, there is information on the fish
                itself, its best flies to be used, and where to find them. In
                the Fly Library, there is information on the fly itself, its
                main purpose, and what fish really love them. It is important to
                know that this guide is meant for the Carolinas, so species
                around the world may act different to this information.
